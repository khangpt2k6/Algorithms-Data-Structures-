## Algorithms

### GCD using Euclidean Algorithm

This algorithm calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two integers using the Euclidean method. It is efficient and widely used in number theory and cryptography.

### Binary Exponentiation

This algorithm computes `a^b % mod` efficiently using the binary exponentiation method. It is particularly useful for handling large exponents in modular arithmetic.

### Binary Search (Iterative and Recursive)

Binary search is a fundamental algorithm for finding an element in a sorted array. Both iterative and recursive implementations are provided.

### Two Sum with Two Pointers

This algorithm checks if there exists a pair of elements in a sorted array that sum up to a given target. It uses the two-pointer technique for efficient searching.

### Sieve of Eratosthenes

This algorithm generates all prime numbers up to a given number `n` using the Sieve of Eratosthenes method. It is highly efficient for generating primes in a range.

### BFS and DFS

Breadth-First Search (BFS) and Depth-First Search (DFS) are fundamental graph traversal algorithms. Both are implemented for traversing or searching tree or graph data structures.

### Dijkstra's Algorithm

This algorithm finds the shortest path from a source node to all other nodes in a weighted graph. It is widely used in routing and network optimization.

### Floyd-Warshall Algorithm

This algorithm computes the shortest paths between all pairs of nodes in a graph. It is useful for solving all-pairs shortest path problems.

### Finding Divisors

This algorithm finds all divisors of a given number efficiently. It is useful in number theory and problem-solving.

### Matrix Multiplication

This algorithm multiplies two matrices efficiently. It is a fundamental operation in linear algebra and computer graphics.

### Fibonacci Sequence (Dynamic Programming)

This algorithm computes the Fibonacci sequence using dynamic programming. It is optimized to avoid redundant calculations.

### String Manipulation

This section includes functions for string reversal, converting strings to lowercase or uppercase, and other common string operations.

### Big Number Operations

This section includes implementations for adding, subtracting, multiplying, dividing, and finding the modulo of large numbers represented as strings.

### Backtracking (Subsets)

This algorithm generates all possible subsets of a given set using backtracking. It is useful for combinatorial problems.
